testing the yesterday's learning about...
editing
staging,
&
committing
and now edited again after putting in staging area but before committing
result: now i can see both options of committing and staging...
I may commit rows 1 to 5 without row 6 or......
I may used git add command to add row 6 and bring it into staging area.
So I have both options.
I have commited the original hello_world.txt file &
and in this step i am going to use git restore command
and lets see what happens.
and I am seeing the file color in red in git status.
again going to stage it
