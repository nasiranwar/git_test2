testing the yesterday's learning about...
editing
staging,
&
committing
and now edited again after putting in staging area but before committing
result: now i can see both options of committing and staging...
I may commit rows 1 to 5 without row 6 or......
I may used git add command to add row 6 and bring it into staging area.
So I have both options.
